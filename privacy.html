                    If you wish to delete the data held by us then you will need to email us at support@talanta.co. If you wish your data to be deleted, then your account will also be deactivated.
                    However, we may be required to store and to not delete such data (or that we may store such data for a certain period, though we will implement your request for deletion as soon as the mandatory storage period expires).

                    In case of termination of the usage relationship, the data of the user will be regularly deleted from our network, except for inventory data insofar as it is required for the establishment or contents of or changes to the contractual relationship.

Furthermore, we may process and/or use the user data if this is done as part of the object of a contractual relationship or a contract-like relationship based on trust and/or insofar as it is done to protect our justified interests and if, following a careful balancing of interests, no reason exists to believe that legitimate interests of user outweigh the exclusion of the processing and/or use of his data.
